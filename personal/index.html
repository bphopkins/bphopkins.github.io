<h3 id="biography">Biographical Bits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> I was born in Riverside, CA, where I lived until I graduated high school. Riverside is great! It's equidistant from the beach, the mountains, and the desert&mdash;so one could theoretically surf, snowboard, and ride dirtbikes all in the same day. </li>
        <li> I grew up in the hills, where I developed a lasting taste for frequent saunters in nature. I also grew up camping, fishing, and occasionally hunting. I long for the ability to do some of these things more often. </li>
        <li> I played baseball for most of my childhood, and I was not bad. I root for the Dodgers. </li>
        <li> I swam and played water polo in high school. I might still hold one or two swimming records&mdash;though less because I was so good and more because my high school was historically not so good. </li>
    </ul>
