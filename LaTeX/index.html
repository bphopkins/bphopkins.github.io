<h3>My Stuff</h3>
    Those who know me know I am a big LaTeX fan.  It started in 2016 when Bas van Fraassen asked me to digitize his <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~fraassen/Formal%20Semantics%20and%20Logic.pdf"><i>Formal Semantics and Logic</i></a>, which was quite a task. Of course, if I were to do it today I would do it differently.
    <br><br>
    And here is some stuff since:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bphopkins/texmf/tree/main">Here</a> is a link to my <code>texmf</code> directory, where I host my custom macros. The readme explains why you might care and how you might set it up for yourself.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bphopkins/texmf/blob/main/tex/latex/french-logic/french-logic.sty">Here</a> is a link to my favorite macro file, <code>french-logic.sty</code>, which I have been developing since coming to Davis. Suggestions for improvements are always welcome.</li>
    </ul>

<h3> LaTeX Workflow with GitHub </h3>

    Here I will eventually explain how to use GitHub as a solution to Overleaf not yet supporting custom global macros.
