<h3>About</h3>
    My interest in philosophy has mainly been in formal stuff.  My M.A. thesis at SFSU was a study of how mathematical language might be seen to "evolve".  At Davis I've focused mostly on the philosophy of mathematics, logic and the philosophy of logic, and analytic metaphysics.  Most of my work at Davis has ended up becoming an exercise in formal semantics.
    <br><br>
    From thinking about bridge principles and the nature of normativity more generally, I have within the last year been surveying the history of philosophical issues in deontic logic, with a special interest in logics of conditional obligation.  More recently I have been surveying (reasons for) nonstandard semantics for nonmonotonic modal conditionals.  What's been most striking to me in all this is that, whereas logics of ethical theories tend not to be all that logically interesting, interactions between meta-ethics and model theory can be.

    I do have profiles at <a href="https://philpeople.org/profiles/brandon-hopkins">PhilPeople</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brandon-Hopkins-4">ResearchGate</a>, although there are no publications. At least there you can see some social networks. Also, see my <a href="https://github.com/bphopkins">GitHub</a> eventually for some useful LaTeX stuff.
